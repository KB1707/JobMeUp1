# JobMeUp

## Problem Statement

Navigating the career landscape has become increasingly difficult, especially for young individuals and professionals entering the job market. A staggering 75% of resumes are rejected by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) before they even reach a human recruiter. This presents a major hurdle for job seekers, as many are unaware of how to optimize their resumes for these systems. 

Beyond resume rejection, over 60% of students and early-career professionals feel lost when choosing a career path, citing a lack of personalized career guidance. This confusion is particularly prevalent among high school students, who struggle to understand their future career options and the steps required to achieve them.
